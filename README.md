Choco-solver is a Free Open-Source [Java](https://www.java.com/fr/) library dedicated to Constraint Programming.
The user models its problem in a declarative way by stating the set of constraints 
that need to be satisfied in every solution.
Then, the problem is solved by alternating constraint filtering algorithms with a search mechanism.
