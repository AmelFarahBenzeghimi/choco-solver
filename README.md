choco-parsers
=============

`choco-parsers` is an extension library for [choco-solver](https://github.com/chocoteam/choco-solver).

It aims at importing models to various format.
It provides a parser for the FlatZinc language, a low-level solver input language that is the target language for [MiniZinc](http://www.minizinc.org/) 
and a parser for [XCSP3](http://xcsp.org), an intermediate integrated XML-based format.

It also provides utilities to export a model written with Choco to a JSON format 
and to import a JSON format file into a `Model`.
