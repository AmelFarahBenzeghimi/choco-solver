What is Choco ?
===============

Choco is a Free and Open-Source Java library dedicated to Constraint Programming.
It aims at describing hard combinatorial problems in the form of Constraint Satisfaction Problems
and solving them with Constraint Programming techniques.

A little bit of history
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The first version of Choco was written in 1999 by François Laburthe and Narendra Jussien in
`Claire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_(programming_language)>`_.
The main objective was to provide an open source library for constraint programming
dedicated to teaching and research.

In 2003, the code was then converted to Java by Hadrien Cambazard, Guillaume Rochart.
Funded by EMN, Bouygues and Amadeus, I was recruited as project leader in 2008.
Together with Hadrien Cambazard and Arnaud Malapert, we developed and maintained Choco-v2.

It was then time for a deep refactoring, with main objective to clean up the code and focus on improving
resolution performances.
A joint work of Jean-Guillaume Fages and I,
with the system expertise of Narendra Jussien and Xavier Lorca,
led to Choco-v3, first released in 2011.
This version won seven medals in four entries in the `MiniZinc Challenge <http://www.minizinc.org/challenge.html>`_.

More recently, Jean-Guillaume and I wanted to review the API and the last version was born.


Why "Choco" ?
+++++++++++++

Choco is the acronym of the french sentence:
"Chouette, une boite à Outils de Contraintes orientée Object" which can be translated into:
"Great, an object-oriented constraint toolbox".


Why using Choco ?

Why using a constraint programming solver ?

And why Choco ?
